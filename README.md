Welcome to the statistical analysis and visualization repository! This repository contains various techniques for data analysis and visualization using Python.I have explored the following methods on a dataset obtained from [GHPR_dataset](https://github.com/feiwww/GHPR_dataset/blob/master/README.md).

## Available Techniques

### 1. Box Plots
Explore the distribution of different variables using interactive box plots. Understand the spread of the data and identify potential outliers.

### 2. Bar Charts
Visualize categorical data using bar charts. Analyze the frequency or count of specific categories within the dataset.

### 3. Control Charts
Implement control charts to monitor the stability and performance of processes over time. Identify variations and deviations in the data.

### 4. Scatter Plots
Create scatter plots to understand relationships between two numerical variables. Analyze patterns, correlations, and outliers.

### 5. Measures of Association
Calculate various measures of association, such as correlation coefficients, to quantify relationships between variables. Understand the strength and direction of these relationships.

### 6. Robust Correlation
Apply robust correlation techniques to handle outliers and skewed data effectively. Obtain reliable correlation measures even in the presence of extreme values.

### 7. Linear Regression
Perform linear regression analysis to model the relationship between independent and dependent variables. Predict outcomes and understand variable influences.

### 8. Robust Regression
Utilize robust regression techniques to build models that are resistant to outliers. Improve the accuracy and reliability of regression predictions.

### 9. Multivariate Regression
Extend regression analysis to multiple independent variables. Explore the impact of multiple predictors on the dependent variable.

### 10. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Self-Study)
Delve into PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Visualize and analyze complex datasets effectively.

## Dataset
The analysis and visualizations in this repository are conducted on a dataset obtained from [GHPR_dataset](https://github.com/feiwww/GHPR_dataset/blob/master/README.md). The dataset provides valuable insights and serves as a foundation for our statistical techniques.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/statistical-analysis-visualization.git
   cd statistical-analysis-visualization
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts corresponding to the technique you want to explore.
